Ask Phase </span>  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"ask_phase_2\"></a>\n\n#### 2.1 Business Task: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"business_task_2_1\"></a> \n\nIdentify trends in how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to apply insights into Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\nStakeholders\n\n* Urška Sršen - Bellabeat co founder and Chief Creative Officer\n\n* Sando Mur - Bellabeat co founder and key member of Bellabeat executive team\n\n* Bellabeat Marketing Analytics team\n\n## <span style=\"color:#FA8072\"> 3. Prepare Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"prepare_phase_3\"></a> \n\n#### 3.1 Dataset used: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"dataset_used_3_1\"></a> \n\n\nOur case study is based on data from the Fitbit Fitness Tracker, sourced from Kaggle and made available by Mobius.\n\n#### 3.2 Accessibility and privacy of data: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"accessibility_and_privacy_of_data_3_2\"></a> \n\nBy reviewing the dataset’s metadata, we verified that it is open source. The owner has relinquished all copyrights worldwide, including related and neighboring rights, to the maximum extent allowed by law. This grants full permission to copy, modify, distribute, and use the data, even for commercial purposes, without requiring approval.\n\n#### 3.3 Information about our dataset:<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"information_about_our_dataset_3_3\"></a>  \n\nThe dataset was created using survey responses collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk between December 3rd and December 5th, 2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users voluntarily shared their personal tracker data, which includes minute-by-minute records of physical activity, heart rate, and sleep patterns. Variations in the data stem from differences in Fitbit device models and individual tracking habits.\n\n#### 3.4 Verification and Organization of Data: <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"verification_and_organization_of_data_3_4\"></a>\n\nThe dataset consists of 18 CSV files, each capturing different quantitative metrics tracked by Fitbit. The data is in a \"long\" format, where each row represents a single time point for a specific user, with multiple entries per user as data is recorded daily and hourly. Each user is assigned a unique ID for identification.\n\nGiven the small sample size, I utilized pivot tables in Google Docs to sort and filter the data for a more structured analysis. This method allowed me to examine attributes and observations across tables, identify relationships between them, and confirm that the analysis spans a 31-day period.\n\n| Table Name | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| dailyActivity_merged | Microsoft Excel CSV | Daily Activity over 31 days of 33 users.

Additionally, the data is outdated and limited to a two-month collection period. To mitigate these challenges, our case study will take an operational approach.\n\n# <span style=\"color:#FA8072\">  4. Process Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"process_phase_4\"></a>\n\nR provides a wide range of statistical and analytical tools that allow me to efficiently process, clean, and analyze large datasets. Its extensive library of packages, such as ggplot2 for visualization and dplyr for data manipulation, makes it well-suited for handling complex data tasks. Additionally, R's strong community support and open-source nature ensure continuous improvements and access to the latest data science techniques.\n\n### 4.1 Installing packages and opening libraries <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"installing_packages_and_opening_libraries_4_1\"></a> \n\nIn order to conduct a comprehensive analysis, we will select and install relevant packages in R. The following packages will be utilized:\n\nInstalling Packages\n\ninstall.packages(“tidyverse”)\n\ninstall.packages(“here”)\n\ninstall.packages(“skimr”)\n\ninstall.packages(“janitor”)\n\ninstall.packages(“lubridate”)\n\ninstall.packages(“ggpubr”)\n\ninstall.packages(“ggrepel”)\n\nOpening Libraries\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nlibrary(skimr)\n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nThese packages will provide us with various tools and functions to handle, analyze and visualize the data, allowing us to carry out a thorough investigation and draw meaningful conclusions.\n\n### 4.2 Importing datasets <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"importing_datasets_4_2\"></a>\n\nKnowing the datasets we have, we will upload the datasets that will help us answer our business task. On our analysis we will focus on the following datasets:\n\nDaily_Activity\n\nDaily_Sleep\n\nHourly_Steps\n\nDue to the small sample size, we will not take into account weight (8 users) and heart rate (7 users) in this analysis.\n\n### 4.3 Preview our datasets <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"preview_our_datasets_4_3\"></a>\n\nWe will examine our chosen data frames by using head and str function in R and review the summary of each column.\n\n### 4.4 Cleaning and formatting <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"cleaning_and_formatting_4_4\"></a>\n\nNow that we have familiarized ourselves with our data structures, \n\nwe will then proceed to process them to identify any errors and inconsistencies.\n\n### 4.5 Merging Datasets <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"merging_datasets_4_5\"></a>\n\nWe will merge Daily_Activity and Daily_Sleep to see any correlation between variables by using ID and date as their primary keys.","metadata":{"_uuid":"26061783-30f5-41b4-b487-8eace7f393c7","_cell_guid":"bc06840b-bcdb-4e9d-80fb-4f8bed7b29ab","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-30T15:13:57.519048Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-30T15:13:57.519353Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-30T15:13:57.532559Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-30T15:13:57.519317Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-30T15:13:57.530611Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":false}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span style=\"color:#FA8072\"> 5. Analyze Phase and Share Phase </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"analyze_phase_5\"></a>\n\nOur objective is to explore how the usage patterns of FitBit users can inform and potentially enhance BellaBeat's marketing strategy. \n\n### 5.1 Type of users per activity level <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"type_of_users_per_activity_level\"></a>\n\n\nSince our dataset lacks demographic variables, we aim to classify users based on their activity levels using the available data. We will achieve this by categorizing users according to their daily step count, following these classifications:\n\n* Sedentary – Fewer than 5,000 steps per day.\n* Lightly active – Between 5,000 and 7,499 steps per day.\n* Fairly active – Between 7,500 and 9,999 steps per day.\n* Very active – More than 10,000 steps per day.\n  \nThis classification is based on the guidelines from the article \"Counting Steps: A Guide to Increasing Physical Activity Through Pedometer Use\" (available at 10000steps.org.au). By adopting this approach, we can better understand user activity levels, uncover patterns and trends, and use these insights to refine our marketing strategy.\n\nWe first will calculate the Daily_Steps_Average by user.\n\nNow that we have added a new column indicating the user_ type, we can create a data frame that shows the percentage of users in each category, which will allow us to visualize the distribution more clearly on a graph.\n\nNow we can see that users are fairly distributed by their activity considering the daily amount of steps. We can determine that based on users activity all kinds of users wear smart-devices.\n\n\n### 5.2 Steps and minutes asleep per weekday <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"steps_and_minutes_asleep_per_weekday\"></a>\n\nWe aim to identify the most active and restful days of the week for our users, as well as assess whether they meet the recommended activity and sleep goals. To achieve this, we will use the date column to determine the day of the week for each record. Then, we will calculate the average number of steps taken and minutes of sleep for each weekday, allowing us to gain insights into users' activity and sleep patterns throughout the week.\n\nBased on the graphs, we can observe that the users generally meet the recommended amount of steps per day of 7500, except for Sundays. However, the users do not meet the recommended amount of sleep, which is 8 hours per night.\n\n### 5.3 Hourly steps throughout the day <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"hourly_steps_throughout_the_day\"></a>\n\nTo further explore our analysis, we aim to determine the specific times of day when users are most active. This can be achieved by utilizing the Hourly_Steps data frame and parsing out the date_time column.\n\nBased on the data analysis, it appears that users tend to be more active between the hours of 8am and 7pm. Specifically, they seem to take more steps during lunchtime, from 12pm to 2pm, as well as in the evenings, between 5pm and 7pm.\n\n### 5.4 Correlations <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"correlations\"></a>\n\nCertainly, we can examine whether there is a correlation between different variables. \n\n* Daily steps and daily sleep\n\n* Daily steps and calories\n\nBased on the analysis, there appears to be no significant correlation between daily activity levels, as measured by steps, and the amount of sleep users get each day. This suggests that the amount of physical activity does not influence sleep duration, indicating that these two variables are independent of each other.\n\nIn contrast, we observed a positive correlation between daily steps and calories burned. This implies that as the number of steps increases, the calories burned also tends to rise. This relationship is likely due to the fact that increased physical activity leads to greater energy expenditure, which consequently results in more calories burned. However, it's important to emphasize that while there is a correlation, it does not necessarily mean causation, and additional analysis would be needed to explore whether there is a direct cause-and-effect link between these two variables.\n\n### 5.5 Use of smart device <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"use_of_smart_device\"></a> \n\n#### 5.5.1 Days used smart device <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"days_used_smart_device\"></a>\n\nTo determine the frequency of device usage among users in our sample, we can create a new data frame that groups the data by Id and calculates the number of days each user used their device. Based on the number of days of usage, we can then classify users into one of three categories:\n\n* High use: Users who used their device between 21 and 31 days.\n* Moderate use: Users who used their device between 10 and 20 days.\n* Low use: Users who used their device between 1 and 10 days.\n  \nHere’s an example of how we can create the new data frame and add the classification column:\n\nThis code will create a new data frame (usage_data) with each user's Id, the number of days they used their device (days_used), and their usage category (usage_category).","metadata":{"_uuid":"39dfaa90-880d-4e08-9e06-e559a3423d47","_cell_guid":"4363fc1f-ea3d-4695-a74a-677d120ff53a","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 5.5.2 Time used smart device <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"time_used_smart_device\"></a>\n\nMerging the Daily_Use data frame and Daily_Activity data frame will allow us to see how many minutes users wear their device per day and filter the results by daily use of the device.\n\nWe need to generate a new data frame that computes the total number of minutes each user wore the device per day, and classify the data into one of three categories:\n\n1. All day: if the device was worn for the entire day.\n\n2. More than half day: if the device was worn for more than half of the day.\n\n3. Less than half day: if the device was worn for less than half of the day.\n\nTo visualize the device usage patterns and facilitate meaningful comparisons, we can create four data frames. These will allow us to compare total usage across the three categories we established and gain insights into different usage patterns. Here's how we can approach the task:\n\n1. First Data Frame (Overall Device Usage by Category):\nThe first data frame will include:\n\nTotal number of users.\nPercentage of users wearing the device All day, More than half day, and Less than half day.\nTo calculate the percentage of time the device was worn in each category, we will compute the total minutes worn per user and classify them into one of the three categories based on how long they wore the device each day.\nThe categories will be defined as:\n\nAll day: The device was worn for at least 90% of the day’s total minutes.\nMore than half day: The device was worn for between 50% and 90% of the day.\nLess than half day: The device was worn for less than 50% of the day.\n\nVisualization:\nOnce we have the four data frames, we can visualize the data to compare overall usage and usage by category. A suitable approach would be to create a multi-panel plot (such as a faceted bar chart or pie chart) showing the percentage of users in each category and the total minutes worn by users in each group. This will help us identify patterns in device usage, such as differences between users who wore their devices all day versus those with more sporadic usage.","metadata":{"_uuid":"9faafe86-9e0c-4183-ae67-c20ccdec131d","_cell_guid":"ca4f8b4f-6dfd-4419-9d9f-f0c471a3a13a","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <span style=\"color:#FA8072\"> 6. Conclusion (Act Phase) </span> <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"conclusion_act_phase\"></a>\n\nBellabeat's mission is to empower women by providing them with the data they need to better understand themselves. Based on the findings of our analysis, I recommend that we leverage our own tracking data for deeper insights into our target audience. The datasets we used had a small sample size and lacked demographic information, which may have introduced biases into our analysis. Given that our primary target audience is young and adult women, it is crucial to identify trends and insights that can help shape a marketing strategy specifically tailored to this group.\n\nBy utilizing our own tracking data, we can obtain more accurate and representative information regarding our users' behaviors and preferences. This will enable us to craft more personalized and impactful marketing campaigns that will better resonate with our target audience and help them unlock the full potential of our products. Ultimately, our objective is to further advance Bellabeat's mission of empowering women through data-driven insights and innovation.\n\nHere are some valuable recommendations based on our analysis:\n\n**Daily Step Notifications and App Posts**: This recommendation aims to encourage users to meet the daily step goal of 8,000 steps as recommended by the CDC. We can send reminders to users who haven't reached this goal, and create posts within the app explaining the benefits of achieving this target. Additionally, we can highlight the positive correlation between step count and calorie burn. This approach will motivate users to be more active while educating them about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.\n\n**Reward System**: We propose developing an in-app game that motivates users to maintain consistent activity levels over time. The game would feature various levels based on the number of steps taken each day, with users earning stars for completing each level. These stars could then be redeemed for merchandise or discounts on other Bellabeat products. This strategy would not only encourage users to stay active but also reward their efforts in a fun and engaging way.\n\n**Sleep Improvement Notifications and Techniques**: This recommendation involves offering users resources to improve their sleep quality. Users could set a desired bedtime, and receive notifications shortly before to help them prepare for sleep. Additionally, we could offer breathing exercises, relaxing podcasts, and sleep techniques to support better sleep habits. This initiative will enhance users' overall health and well-being.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, Bellabeat can empower women with the data and tools they need to improve their health and wellness, and support their journey of self-discovery.\n\nBased on our analysis, we found that only 50% of users engage with their devices daily, and just 36% wear them all day when they do. To promote Bellabeat's products, we can highlight key features such as water resistance, long battery life, and stylish designs. These features will allow customers to confidently wear their devices every day, no matter the occasion, without concerns about battery performance.\n\n### <span style=\"color:#FA8072\"> **Own your future by owning your data** </span>","metadata":{"_uuid":"b91c3c32-f954-44d2-ac6c-f6b83b034df3","_cell_guid":"217f113b-ce37-4934-9357-848960dd483d","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}}]}
